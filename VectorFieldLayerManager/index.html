    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>The vector field manager is used to support displaying vector field data such as earth deformation, tidal in
        which
        attributes of point features define a vector quantity - one with distance and direction.
        It displays the vectors as arrows that are scaled and oriented according selected attributes of data points.
        It can only be used to render point data - line and polygon layers are not drawn by this symbology.
    </p>
    <p>The vector field is defined by attributes in the data, which can represent the field either
        by cartesian components (x and y components of the field), or polar coordinates.
        If polar coordinates are used, the angle may be measured either eastwards from north, or northwards from east,
        and may be either in degrees or radians. The magnitude of field can be scaled up or down to an appropriate size
        for viewing the field.</p>
    <p>As a special case the renderer can also display "height only" data, which displays a vertical arrow scaled using
        an attribute of the data.
        This is appropriate for displaying the vertical component of deformation, for example.
    </p>
    <p>The renderer also has options for displaying an error ellipse associated with the vector. The error
        ellipse is displayed centred on the end of the arrow. It is defined by attributes of the data which can be
        one of
    </p>
    <ul>
        <!-- <li>Covariance components.  These represent the variance of the X component (Cxx), the variance of the 
    Y component (Cyy), and the covariance of the X and Y components (Cxy).</li> -->
        <li>Error ellipse axes. The ellipse is defined in terms of the length of the semi-major and
            semi-minor axes, and the orientation of the semi-major axis. In the same way as the vector orientation,
            this can be measured eastwards from north, or northwards from east, and can be in degrees or radians.</li>
        <li>Circular. The error is circular and defined just by the radius (ie the standard error of the X and Y
            components). </li>
        <li>Height. The &quot;ellipse&quot; is defined by the error of a height component. In this case the
            error is displayed as a vertical bar rather than an ellipse. This corresponds to the height type
            vector field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whichever form of error ellipse is used, it can be scaled by a constant value, for example multiplying by 2.45 to
        convert variances to a 95% confidence limit.</p>
    <p>The renderer can be used to display just the error ellipse by selecting an vector field type of &quot;No
        Arrow&quot;.</p>

    <p>Note that the renderer does not take account of on-the-fly projection of the map or rotation of the map. The
        arrows and error ellipses
        are drawn as if north is towards the top of the map.

        include an alpha value, eg &quot;#CCFFcc00&quot;. Also some colour names can be used, eg &quot;red&quot;.

    <h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
    <p>The VectorFieldManager plugin for QGIS 3.0 is a partial replacement for the VectorFieldRenderer plugin in QGIS2.
        The vector field renderer method of implementation proved difficult to migrate to QGIS3. This plugin replicates
        the majority of that functionality.
    </p>
    <p>The main features not implemented in this plugin are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The scale box which displays a box on the map canvas showing the scale of the vector field arrows and error
            ellipses</li>
        <li>Options for orienting the vectors relative to true north rather than the canvas grid north</li>
        <li>Rotating the vectors if the map canvas is rotated</li>
        <li>Defining vector components as expressions rather than as data fields</li>
        <li>The symbology is not configured using the layer properties symbology tab - it is configured with a separate
            dialog.</li>
    </ul>
