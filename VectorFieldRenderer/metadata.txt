description=Draw a point layer with arrow symbols
about=Renders a point layer with arrows representing vectors.  The 
  size and orientation of the arrow is data defined.  Typically this
  would be used to represent movement, fluid flow or ground deformation
  for example.  The plugin can also draw an ellipse representing the
  error covariance of the vector.  The scale of the arrows can be easily
  changed using buttons on the toolbar.  The plugin also can
  draw a scale box on the map.
