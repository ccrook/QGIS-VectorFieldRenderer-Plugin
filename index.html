<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The vector field renderer is used to display vector field data such as earth deformation, tidal flows, and the like.  It displays the vectors as arrows that are scaled and oriented according selected attributes of data points. 
It can only be used to render point data - line and polygon layers are not drawn by this symbology.
</p>
<p>The vector field is defined by attributes in the data, which can represent the field either by cartesian components (x and y components of the field), or polar coordinates. If polar coordinates are used, the angle may be measured either eastwards from north, or northwards from east, and may be either in degrees or radians. The magnitude of field can be scaled up or down to an appropriate size for viewing the field.</p>
<p>As a special case the renderer can also display "height only" data, which displays a vertical arrow scaled using an attribute of the data.  This is appropriate for displaying the vertical component of deformation, for example.
</p>
<p>
The renderer also has options for displaying an error ellipse associated with the vector.  The error
ellipse is displayed centred on the end of the arrow.  It is defined by attributes of the data which can be
one of 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Covariance components.  These represent the variance of the X component (Cxx), the variance of the 
    Y component (Cyy), and the covariance of the X and Y components (Cxy).</li>
    <li>Error ellipse axes.  The ellipse is defined in terms of the length of the semi-major and 
    semi-minor axes, and the orientation of the semi-major axis.  In the same way as the vector orientation,
    this can be measured eastwards from north, or northwards from east, and can be in degrees or radians.</li>
    <li>Circular.  The error is circular and defined just by the radius (ie the standard error of the X and Y components).  </li>
    <li>Height.  The &quot;ellipse&quot; is defined by the error of a height component.  In this case the
    error is displayed as a vertical bar rather than an ellipse.  This corresponds to the height type
    vector field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever form of error ellipse is used, it can be scaled by a constant value, for example multiplying by 2.45 to convert variances to a 95% confidence limit.</p>
<p>The renderer can be used to display just the error ellipse by selecting an vector field type of &quot;No Arrow&quot;.</p>

<img src="VectorScaleBox.png" alt="Scale box" style="float:right" />
<p>
The renderer also displays a scale box on the map showing how the arrow size relates to the corresponding vector length.
</p>
<p>Note that the renderer does not take account of on-the-fly projection of the map - the arrows are drawn assuming that north is towards the top of the map.
</p>
<h2><a name="rendering">Rendering a vector field</a></h2>
<img src="RendererDialog.png" alt="Renderer dialog" style="float:right" />
<p>
A vector field is displayed by changing its symbology.  Right click on the layer in the 
layers list, and select the symbology tab.  In the renderer drop down select "Vector field".  This will display the options for configuring the symbology. (Note: to see the renderer in the drop down the "new symbology" must be selected.)
</p>
<p>The dialog has two main sections - the top section defines how the vector field is expressed in the data, and the bottom section defines characteristics of the arrow symbology.  The dialog also has a tab for
configuring the error ellipse.
</p>
<p>The fields in the dialog are:</p>
<div style="clear:both"/>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Vector field type
</td>
<td>Selects the field type - cartesian, polar, or height only, as described above.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>... attribute

<td>Selects the data attributes which define the vector field, either X/Y for cartesian fields, length/angle for polar fields, or height for the height only field
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Angle orientation/units
</td>
<td>Defines how the angle is defined in the data.  The orientation is one of North from East (North is 0&deg;, East is 90&deg;) or East from North (East is 0&deg;, North is 90&deg;).  The units are either degrees or radians.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Arrow size
</td>
<td>Defines the size of the components of the arrow.  The arrow has three components - the arrow head, the shaft, and the base.  The head may change size according to the length of the vector - the shaft width and base size are fixed.  The sizes are:
<table class="details">
<tr>
<td>Head (relative)</td>
<td>The size of the head relative to the length of the arrow.  If this size is zero then the maximum head size is used for all arrow heads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Head (max)</td>
<td>The maximum size of the head, overrides the relative size.  The size is in terms of the symbol units (see below).  If this size is zero then no maximum applies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Head border width</td>
<td>The width of the arrow head border.  The size is in terms of the symbol units (see below)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shaft width</td>
<td>The width of the arrow shaft.  The size is in terms of the symbol units (see below)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<tr>
<td>Arrow colour
</td>
<td>Defines the colour of the arrow shaft and head, whether the head of the arrow is filled, and the colour used to fill the head of the arrow.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Arrow shape
</td>
<td>
<img src="ArrowHeadShape.png" alt="Renderer ellipse dialog" style="float:right" />
    Defines the shape of the arrow.  The arrow is defined by three relative x values - these measured relative to the endpoint of the vector and in the direction of the 
    vector.  They are scaled by the size of the arrow head to define the coordinates with which the arrow is plotted.  The three values are illustrated here.  They are based on
    the end of the vector (&quot;base&quot;). The values define the coordinates of the middle of the arrow head border.  As a special case, if the front measurement is 0 (ie the 
    tip of the arrow should be on the end of the vector) then the coordinates are adjusted to bring the actual tip of the arrow onto that point, rather than the middle of the 
   arrow border.  Also if the centre measurement is the same as the front measurement, then the arrow head is a simple line, rather than a polygon.   
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
    <td>Symbol units</td>
<td>Selects either millimetres, or map units.  Defines the units define the arrow sizes.  If millimetres are selected, then the arrow sizes are defined in millimetres on the plotted map, and will not change as the map scale changes.  If map units, then the arrow will scale up and down as the map scale changes.

Note that if the arrow is defined in map units, then these are the same.  The length of each vector will be multiplied by this scale for representing on the map.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Scale group
</td>
<td>Defines a scale group label for the layer.  Layers rendered with the same scale group will be forced to use the same scale.  This must be a simple name, for example "displacement".  The name can optionally followed by "*" and a mupltiple, which scale the arrow at the specified multiple of the group scale (for example "displacement*2").
</td>

</td>
<td>Defines text that will displayed alongside the symbology on the legend
</td>

An error ellipse can be displayed for the vector by configuring using the Error ellipse tab of the
symbology properties.

        ellipse size and shape.  
    </td>
